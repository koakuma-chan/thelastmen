## A Nietzschean News Transmutation Engine

This project, born from the abyss of modern information, seeks to elevate the mundane news of the masses into profound proclamations worthy of the Ãœbermensch. Through the alchemy of AI, we transmute the leaden words of cbc.ca into golden aphorisms that would make even Zarathustra nod in approval.

### Features:

- Crawls the depths of cbc.ca, unearthing the hidden truths beneath the surface
- Harnesses the power of artificial intelligence to channel the spirit of Friedrich Nietzsche
- Transforms banal news articles into existential declarations and moral imperatives
- Built with the unyielding strength of Rust and the cosmic reach of Astro

### Usage:

Gaze into the abyss of this news site, and the abyss gazes also into you. Prepare to question your values, challenge your morals, and dance with the eternal return of information.

Remember, dear reader: He who fights with monsters should look to it that he himself does not become a monster. And when you gaze long into an AI-generated news article, the news article also gazes into you.

### Warning:

This project is not for the weak-willed or those who cling to slave morality. Proceed only if you are ready to become who you are.
